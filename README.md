# GITHUB.PROJECT

## 📖 Project Description
**GITHUB.PROJECT** is a decentralized smart contract designed to simulate basic GitHub-like functionality on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It allows users to create repositories, update their information, and transfer ownership securely — all without a centralized server.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To bring open-source collaboration to the blockchain by enabling developers to manage and showcase projects transparently and immutably.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Create Repositories:** Add new repositories with a name and description.
- **Update Repositories:** Owners can modify repository descriptions anytime.
- **Transfer Ownership:** Seamlessly hand over project ownership to another wallet.
- **On-chain Transparency:** Every action is stored immutably and publicly on the Ethereum ledger.

---

## 🧩 Future Enhancements
- Add version tracking for repository updates.
- Integrate with IPFS to store project files.
- Develop a frontend dApp for interacting with the contract visually.
